                <p class="mb-8 text-xl">Investing in a stock market feels like a roller-coaster ride to investors as
                    there are many ups and downs in the market. Various events and factors like interest rates, market
                    conditions, and demand & supply define the movement in the Indian stock market. For instance, if the
                    market has confidence in the economy, the market starts soaring but if any natural calamity occurs,
                    the market sees a correction, the degree of which depends on the severity of the event.

                    Before heading forward, letâ€™s understand what market rally and market crash mean. The market is up
                    means a situation when the stock market trades higher than it was at any time in the past. While a
                    market crash is when the market falls suddenly or in a day or two, resulting in a significant loss
                    to the investors.

                    Now, we will take a quick look at the major events that either soared or shook the Indian stock
                    market in the last 10 years.</p>

            </li>
            <p>In January 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 was reported, people thought it was just panic and it
                would end soon. But then in March 2020, we witnessed the world coming to a standstill. The reports of
                rapidly increasing COVID-19 cases worried investors as they feared uncertainty, resulting in a very
                sharp decline in the market. On 23rd March 2020, the closing price for NIFTY 50 was 7601.25 on 23rd
                March 2020, compared to 11303.30 on 03rd March 2020, while BSE SENSEX reported a downfall of 4000 points
                i.e. from 29,915.96 on 20th March 2020 to 25,981.24 on 23rd March 2020. The lockdown which was imposed
                didnâ€™t bring any relief to the market, however, the market started recovering after a certain period.

            </li>
            <p>
                Remember when the ruling government on the evening of 8th November 2016 suddenly made Rs. 500 and Rs.
                1000 notes non-functional? Who can forget that, right? This act in which the current form (s) of money
                is retired and pulled out of circulation, generally, to be replaced with a new form (s) is known as
                Demonetization. Even though this step causes a cash crunch, it was taken in order to bring more
                stability to the economy, fight corruption, and provide more transparency to informal activities.<br>

                The announcement of demonetization decreased consumersâ€™ purchasing power, thus, impacting the sale in
                various industries such as automobile, real estate, and more. This resulted in the fall in the stock
                prices of companies leading to a downfall in the stock market. NIFTY50 registered a 5.1% fall in the
                daily closing price as compared to the closing price on the date of the announcement, the week after it
                was announced.</p>

                Corporate Tax is a tax levied by the government on the net income of the company. On 20th September
                2019, the BSE index registered its biggest gain since 2009 as it witnessed a jump of 5.03%, while the
                NIFTY rallied 569 points in a single day. This was after the Financial Minister announced a cut in this
                corporate tax rate. The government took this historical decision of cutting the corporate tax from 30%
                to 22% without incentives and from 25% to 15% for new manufacturing entities in order to reignite the
                economy.</p>
